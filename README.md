# Blumira Integration Project

## Objective

Welcome to my Blumira Integration Project! In this endeavor, I set up Blumira's dynamic blocklisting capabilities using pfBlockerNG on a pfSense firewall to enhance our network security. This project also involved deploying a Blumira sensor and honeypot to monitor and analyze potential threats effectively. It's an excellent hands-on experience for anyone looking to delve into network security and threat detection, especially those at the beginning of their IT careers.

### Skills Learned

Through this project, I gained valuable skills, including:

- **Deployment of Blumira Sensor and Honeypot**: Successfully set up a Blumira sensor on an Ubuntu server and configured it to function as a honeypot for enhanced security monitoring.
- **Integration with pfSense and pfBlockerNG**: Implemented dynamic blocklists in pfSense using pfBlockerNG, effectively filtering harmful traffic.
- **Monitoring Network Traffic**: Analyzed extensive network logs to understand traffic patterns and identify potential security incidents.
- **Vulnerability Generation and Testing**: Created intentional vulnerabilities to test the effectiveness of the security measures implemented.

### Tools Used

Here’s a quick overview of the tools and technologies employed in this project:

- **Blumira**: Cloud-based SIEM solution for monitoring and incident response.
- **pfSense**: Open-source firewall/router software to manage network traffic.
- **pfBlockerNG**: pfSense package for creating IP and DNS blocklists.
- **Ubuntu Server**: Operating system used to host the Blumira sensor.
- **Docker**: Containerization platform used for deploying the Blumira sensor.

## Introduction

In this guide, I will walk you through the steps I took to integrate Blumira with our existing pfSense firewall. This project aimed to enhance our network security posture by implementing dynamic blocklisting and deploying a honeypot for threat detection.

## Setting Up the Ubuntu Server

To get started, I set up an Ubuntu server that would host the Blumira sensor. Here’s how I did it:

1. **Begin Installation**:
   - Follow the on-screen prompts to install Ubuntu Server with default settings.

2. **Choose Type of Install**:
   - Select Ubuntu Server and proceed with the installation.

3. **Configure Network Connections**:
   - Configure a static IP address using CIDR format (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24) to ensure consistent connectivity.

4. **Storage Configuration**:
   - Edit the storage configuration to utilize the entire disk and set it to the maximum usable size.

5. **SSH Setup**:
   - Select the option to install the OpenSSH server, allowing for remote access.

6. **Complete Installation**:
   - After the installation is complete, reboot the server.

## Building and Installing the Blumira Sensor

Once the Ubuntu server was up and running, I proceeded to install the Blumira sensor:

1. **Allowlist URLs**:
   - Ensure that the firewall permits outbound traffic to the URLs provided in the Blumira documentation.

2. **Log Into Ubuntu**:
   - Use an SSH client (e.g., PuTTY) to connect to the Ubuntu server with the credentials created during installation.

3. **Update System**:
   - Run the command: 
     ```bash
     sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
     ```

4. **Configure NTP Servers**:
   - Set NTP servers for time synchronization:
     ```bash
     NTP="0.pool.ntp.org 1.pool.ntp.org 2.pool.ntp.org 3.pool.ntp.org"
     sudo sed -ie "s/#*NTP=.*/NTP=$NTP/" /etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf
     sudo systemctl restart systemd-timesyncd
     ```

5. **Build and Install Sensor**:
   - In the Blumira dashboard, navigate to Settings > Sensors, and create a new sensor.
   - Copy the installation script generated for the Linux terminal and run it in the SSH session.
   - After installation, ensure that the Docker container is running, and reboot the sensor.

## Deploying the Honeypot

With the Blumira sensor in place, I configured it as a honeypot:

1. **Enable Honeypot Capability**:
   - Run a curl script generated by the Blumira SIEM to enable the honeypot functionality on the server.

2. **Testing the Honeypot**:
   - In the browser, access the honeypot via the sensor's IP address and the designated port (e.g., `http://192.168.1.82:8080`).
   - Attempt to log in using invalid credentials, triggering an authentication failure alert.

## Configuring pfBlockerNG

Next, I configured pfBlockerNG on the pfSense firewall to implement dynamic blocklists:

1. **Access pfSense Web Interface**:
   - Open a browser and navigate to the pfSense interface.

2. **Install pfBlockerNG**:
   - Go to System > Package Manager > Available Packages, search for pfBlockerNG, and install it.

3. **Configure IP Blocklists**:
   - In pfBlockerNG, navigate to the IPv4 tab and add a new IP blocklist.
     - Description: Name the blocklist (e.g., Blumira_IP_Blocklist).
     - List URL: Enter the Blumira IP blocklist URL.
     - Set the update frequency and save the configuration.

4. **Configure DNSBL and URL Blocklists**:
   - Follow the same steps to configure DNS and URL blocklists using the URLs from Blumira.

## Monitoring Network Traffic

After deploying the sensor and configuring the blocklists, I began monitoring network traffic:

1. **Traffic Analysis**:
   - I observed significant traffic from our public-facing Unifi networks, with the firewall forwarding around 500 million logs this month.

2. **Generating Alerts**:
   - I generated alerts by conducting registry SAM dumps, performing Nmap and Advanced IP Scanner scans, and executing brute force attempts on an Active Directory account. Additionally, I stored fake passwords in a text file and granted unusual permissions to another user in our Microsoft 365 tenant.

## Conclusion

This project significantly enhanced our organization's security posture by integrating Blumira with our existing pfSense setup. Through deploying a sensor and honeypot, configuring dynamic blocklists, and actively monitoring network traffic, I gained valuable insights into threat detection and incident response. I hope this guide inspires you to implement similar solutions in your own environment to bolster security!
